lbl.repSel.heading=Coverage Report Selection:

tt.zeroCoverage=In certain cases (especially with checked coverage), some individual test cases have a coverage \
  score of 0. This option will keep them in the reduced test suite. Otherwise they are discarded.
tt.deactivate=This option will write modified source code files with deactivated redundant test cases to the directory \
  specified in the "Settings" tab. Otherwise, only a report will be generated.
